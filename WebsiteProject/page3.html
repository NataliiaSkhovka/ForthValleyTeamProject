                <br><b class="text-subs">What Is Ethical Hacking?</b> 
                <br>Ethical hacking refers to the authorized practice of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems to improve their security. Ethical hackers, 
                    also known as white-hat hackers, use their skills to mimic the actions of malicious hackers but in a lawful and beneficial way.
                <br><br><br><b class="text-subs">Purpose of Ethical Hacking:</b>
                <br>•	To prevent breaches by identifying vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.
                <br>•	To improve security systems by testing defenses under real-world conditions.
                <br>•	To protect sensitive data by mitigating risks in applications and infrastructure.
                <br><br><br><b class="text-subs">Techniques Used in Ethical Hacking:</b>
                <br><b>Penetration Testing: </b> Simulating attacks to find weak points in networks, applications, or systems.
                <br><br><b>Vulnerability Scanning: </b> Using tools like Nessus or OpenVAS to identify known vulnerabilities.
                <br><br><b>Social Engineering Tests: </b> Mimicking phishing attempts or pretexting to evaluate employee awareness.
                <br><br><br><b class="text-subs">Examples of Ethical Hacking:</b>  
                <br><b>Bug Bounty Programs: </b> Companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft reward ethical hackers for reporting security flaws. For instance, a hacker discovered a vulnerability in Tesla’s systems and was awarded $15,000.
                <br><br><b>Penetration Testing: </b> A cybersecurity firm identifies a misconfigured firewall in a bank, preventing a potential ransomware attack.
                <br><br><b>Compliance Testing: </b> Ethical hackers ensure systems comply with security standards like ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, or GDPR.
                <br><br>Ethical hacking is conducted with permission, in contrast to malicious hacking, which is unauthorized and illegal.

            <span id="hiddenText1" style="display: none;">
              <p>
                    <br><b class="text-subs">Historical Cybercrime Examples:</b>
                    <br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Morris Worm (1988): </b>One of the first worms spread over the internet, created by Robert Tappan Morris, a graduate student at Cornell University. Morris designed the worm to measure 
                     the size of the internet. It exploited vulnerabilities in Unix systems and replicated itself excessively, causing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. 
                      The Breach was disrupted Iran's nuclear program by causing 
                      centrifuges to spin out of control, damaging equipment. It infected approximately 10% of the computers connected to the internet at the time. 
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented?</i></b> Strengthen physical and logical security measures, disable USB ports
                      where not needed, and monitor SCADA systems for unusual activity could prevent this.
                      <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Melissa Virus (1999): </b> The Melissa virus was created by David L. Smith, a programmer from New Jersey.
                     Smith claimed he created the virus as a prank and did not intend for it to cause as much damage as it did. However, it ended up spreading uncontrollably.
                     The virus was a Microsoft Word macro virus that spread through email. When a user opened an infected Word document attached to an email, the virus would automatically send itself to the first 50 contacts in the victim’s 
                     Microsoft Outlook address book. This rapid spread overloaded email servers, causing significant disruption to companies and government agencies.
                     <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented?</i></b> Warning users about opening email attachments from unknown sources; using email security tools to scan and block suspicious attachments;
                     disabling macros in Microsoft Word by default; updating antivirus definitions to detect and block macro viruses.
                     <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Target Data Breach (2013): </b>The attack was carried out by a group of cybercriminals, possibly linked to Eastern European hackers. The stolen data was later sold on the dark web.
                     The hackers aimed to steal credit card data and personal information from millions of customers for financial gain.
                     The hackers gained access to Target's network using stolen credentials from a third-party HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) vendor.
                     Once inside the system, they installed malware on Target’s point-of-sale (POS) systems, which captured credit card details of customers when they made purchases.
                     The stolen data was then exfiltrated (sent out) to external servers controlled by the attackers.
                     <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented?</i></b> Target should have restricted third-party access to sensitive systems and enforced multi-factor authentication (MFA).
                     If Target had isolated its payment systems from other parts of its network, hackers might not have been able to access the POS systems.
                     The company should have used real-time monitoring to detect unusual activity on its network.
                     Conducting frequent cybersecurity assessments to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
                     Encrypting credit card data at every stage of processing to make it useless to hackers.
                     This breach cost Target over $200 million in legal fees, settlements, and security upgrades, highlighting the importance of strong cybersecurity measures.
                    <br><br><br><b class="text-subs">Current Cybercrime Examples:</b>
                    <br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021): </b> A Russian cybercriminal group known as DarkSide.
                     The group deployed ransomware, likely entering the network through a compromised VPN password. The ransomware encrypted critical systems, halting pipeline operations.
                     Disruption to fuel supplies across the U.S. East Coast. The company paid $4.4 million in Bitcoin to the attackers.
                    <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented?</i></b>  Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access, regularly update and patch systems, and train employees on identifying phishing attempts.
                    <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~  MOVEit Cyber Attack (2023): </b> In 2023, hackers targeted MOVEit, a file-sharing software used by many big companies. The Clop ransomware group found a flaw in the software that let them break in and 
                    steal sensitive data from businesses like IBM, Deloitte, and Ernst & Young. They then demanded money from these companies, threatening to leak the stolen data if they didn’t pay. This attack highlighted the risks of using 
                    third-party software and how important it is to fix security issues quickly. Clop is a Russian-speaking cybercriminal group known for ransomware and extortion attacks. Instead of encrypting files like traditional ransomware,
                    Clop steals sensitive data and demands a ransom to prevent its public release—a tactic called double extortion. Clop hackers discovered a zero-day vulnerability (a security flaw unknown to the software maker) in MOVEit Transfer, a widely used file-sharing software. 
                    This vulnerability (later named CVE-2023-34362) allowed hackers to inject malicious code into MOVEit servers. 
                    The flaw in MOVEit was an SQL injection vulnerability, which means hackers could send malicious commands to the database through the software’s web interface. 
                    By exploiting this flaw, Clop gained control over the database and accessed sensitive data stored by organizations.
                    Once inside, Clop exfiltrated massive amounts of personal and corporate data from companies using MOVEit. 
                    This included employee records, customer information, financial documents, and other sensitive files. 
                    Instead of encrypting the data like in a typical ransomware attack, Clop used double extortion: 
                    They contacted victims and demanded a ransom in exchange for not leaking their stolen data. 
                    If companies refused to pay, Clop threatened to publish the data on their dark web leak site.  
                    <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented?</i></b> Third-party software risks: Even secure companies can be vulnerable if they rely on software with hidden security flaws. 
                    SQL injection is still a major threat, even though it’s one of the oldest hacking techniques. 
                    Zero-day vulnerabilities are highly valuable to hackers and need immediate patching once discovered. 
                    Double extortion tactics are becoming more common, where hackers steal data and demand payment rather than just locking systems with ransomware.

                <br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ AI-Enhanced Cybercrime: </b> Cybercriminals, including nation-state actors, organized cybercrime groups, and individual hackers, are leveraging AI to automate and enhance their attacks.
                <br><br><b class="text-subs4">AI enables attackers to:</b>
                <br><br>&emsp;•	Create highly personalized phishing emails that mimic real messages and fool even tech-savvy users.
                <br>&emsp;•	Develop AI-powered malware that adapts and evades detection.
                <br>&emsp;•	Automate password cracking and credential stuffing attacks at an unprecedented scale.
                <br><br>Attackers use AI to scrape social media, emails, and online data to craft realistic messages that trick users into clicking malicious links.
                AI-generated deepfake videos or audio are used to impersonate executives or employees to commit fraud (e.g., Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams).
                Some malware uses machine learning to detect and bypass antivirus software or modify itself to remain undetected.
                <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented? </i></b> Using AI-driven cybersecurity tools to detect unusual patterns and prevent attacks.

                Email filtering & anomaly detection, implementing advanced spam filters that detect AI-generated phishing emails.
                <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Zero-Day Exploits: </b> Cybercriminal groups, nation-state actors, and independent hackers searching for vulnerabilities to exploit before security patches are available.
                Some zero-days are sold on the dark web to the highest bidder. Zero-day exploits allow attackers to breach systems before a fix is available, making them highly effective for espionage, financial gain, or sabotage.
                Companies and governments often scramble to patch the flaws, leaving systems vulnerable for days, weeks, or even months.
                Hackers discover an unknown vulnerability in software, operating systems, or hardware.
                They develop exploit code and use it to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or install malware.
                <br><br><b class="text-subs4">Example: Log4Shell (2021)</b>
                Attackers exploited a vulnerability in Apache Log4j, a widely used logging framework, allowing them to execute remote code on affected systems.
                This impacted millions of devices worldwide, including cloud services, enterprise software, and government systems.
                <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How Could It Have Been Prevented? </i></b> Organizations must quickly update systems when security patches are released.
                Zero-Trust Security Model, never trust any system or user by default, reducing the impact of zero-day attacks.
                Bug Bounty Programs, encouraging ethical hackers to report vulnerabilities before criminals exploit them.

                      <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Trojan Horses: </b> Hackers and cybercriminals disguise malware as legitimate software to trick users into installing malicious programs.
                      Trojans appear as useful software but contain hidden malware that grants remote access or steals data.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs4">Example: Back Orifice Trojan (1998)</b> – Created by hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, this trojan provided remote access to infected machines without the user's knowledge.
                      <br>Used for data theft, spying, and launching cyberattacks on organizations.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How to Prevent? </i></b>Avoid untrusted downloads, only install software from official sources.
                      Use endpoint protection, monitor and block suspicious applications.
                      Regular system audits, identify and remove unauthorized software.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs">Current Techniques:</b>
                      <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS): </b> Cybercriminal groups like REvil, DarkSide, and LockBit sell ransomware kits to other attackers.
                      RaaS providers offer ransomware tools for a fee or a share of the ransom, enabling even low-skilled attackers to launch ransomware attacks.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs4">Example: Colonial Pipeline Attack (2021)</b> - DarkSide, a RaaS group, deployed ransomware to shut down fuel distribution in the U.S. East Coast, demanding millions in ransom.
                      <br>RaaS makes ransomware accessible to anyone, leading to massive increases in cyber extortion.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How to Prevent? </i></b> Regular data backups, keep secure, offline backups.
                      Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), detect and stop ransomware before encryption begins.
                      Proactive threat intelligence, monitor dark web activity for emerging threats.
                      <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Credential Stuffing: </b> Cybercriminals leveraging previous data breaches to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
                      Attackers use automated tools to try stolen username/password combinations across multiple websites.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs4">Example: Disney+ Credential Stuffing Attack (2019)</b> -
                      Hackers used leaked credentials from other breaches to gain access to Disney+ accounts, reselling them online.
                      <br>People reuse passwords, making this method highly effective for account takeovers.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How to Prevent? </i></b>Use unique passwords, never reuse passwords across different sites.
                      Enable MFA, prevents unauthorized logins even if credentials are stolen.
                      Monitor for leaked credentials, use services like Have I Been Pwned to check if credentials have been compromised.
                      <br><br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;~ Deepfake Scams: </b> Cybercriminals use AI-generated voice or video to impersonate executives and deceive employees.
                      Attackers use AI tools to create realistic fake audio and video, fooling victims into wiring money or disclosing secrets.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs4">Example: CEO Fraud Deepfake Scam (2019)</b> -
                      Cybercriminals used AI-generated voice to impersonate a company’s CEO, convincing an employee to transfer $243,000 to a fraudulent account.
                      <br>Deepfakes bypass traditional fraud detection methods and can be used for financial scams, blackmail, and political manipulation.
                      <br><br><b class="text-subs5"><i>How to Prevent? </i></b>Verify requests, use multi-person approvals for financial transactions.
                      Monitor AI threats, train employees to recognize signs of deepfake fraud.
                      Voice authentication, use code words or biometric verification for sensitive communications.
